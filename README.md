Overview
Forecasting future air passenger volume based on historical monthly data using time series models. This project compares SARIMA and Prophet models to identify the best forecasting approach for long-term demand planning.

Key Techniques
Time Series Decomposition, SARIMA Modeling, Facebook Prophet, Hyperparameter Tuning (AIC/BIC), Forecast Accuracy Metrics (MAPE, RMSE, MAE)

Outcome
Prophet provided better handling of seasonal patterns and trend changes, making it the preferred model for future passenger demand forecasting.
